# Emergency Room Dashboard

Heartbits Health operates a busy emergency room facility that receives hundreds of patients weekly. The hospital prioritises timely care, accurate patient tracking, and high-quality service delivery. As emergency room traffic continues to rise, Heartbits Health is facing growing pressure to deliver prompt and efficient care while maintaining high patient satisfaction. However, despite having access to basic operational metrics, Heartbits Health has struggled with effectively identifying peak periods, managing patient flow and reducing wait times, delivering prompt and efficient care that improves patient satisfaction and maintaining high patient satisfaction across demographics. This has necessitated the need for a more interactive and visual approach to understanding daily and hourly patient flow, race and age group distributions, and service responsiveness. They are therefore seeking a data science professional who will analyse their data and design an interactive ER dashboard that provides real-time insights for administrators, doctors, and stakeholders, empowering data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and patient outcomes. 

## Current Challenges

## Business Challenges
1.	Increasing Patient Volume
o	Growing ER traffic creates bottlenecks during peak hours.
2.	Wait Time Management
o	Patients experience delays due to poor resource allocation.
3.	Patient Satisfaction Tracking
o	Lack of comprehensive visibility into satisfaction trends by demographics.
4.	Equitable Care Delivery
o	Disparities in service responsiveness across different age and race groups.

## Data & Technical Challenges
1.	Data Fragmentation
o	Patient admissions, wait times, and satisfaction data are stored in silos.
2.	Limited Visualization
o	Existing reporting is static, limiting real-time decision-making.
3.	Granularity Issues
o	Difficulty tracking patient flow at hourly and daily levels.
4.	Scalability
o	Current monitoring does not adapt well to rising patient volumes.

## Aim
To develop an interactive Tableau dashboard that enables HeartBits Health to monitor ER performance in real time, reduce wait times, allocate staff efficiently, and improve patient satisfaction.

## Objectives
•	Operational Insights
o	Track admissions, discharges, and wait times.
o	Identify peak traffic hours to support scheduling.
•	Performance Monitoring
o	Measure patient satisfaction across age, race, and condition categories.
o	Detect service gaps for continuous improvement.
•	Resource Optimization
o	Support hospital administrators in allocating staff and resources effectively.
•	Data-Driven Decision Making
o	Enable management to make strategic and tactical decisions based on real-time data.

## Integration Strategy 
•	Data Sources:
o	Emergency room patient records.
o	Demographics (age, race).
o	Operational metrics (admissions, wait times, satisfaction scores).
•	Dashboard Scope:
o	Admissions and discharge trends.
o	Average wait times by demographic and time of day.
o	Patient satisfaction heatmaps.
o	Staff allocation insights.
•	Tools & Technology:
o	Tableau for dashboard creation.
o	Calculated fields for KPIs (wait time averages, satisfaction scores).
o	Filters for demographic and time-based analysis.

## Detailed Steps 

•	Data Sourcing and Preparation:

o	Dataset cleaning and formatting.

o	Data moving staging, table creation

## Visual Representation of Data Moving, table creation and joining

o	Proper data assignment (numerical, categorical, date).

•	Creating calculated Fields for KPIs, Metrics & visualisations

•	Visualisation Creation

•	Dashboard Development

•	Data analysis and Forecasting

•	Recommendations

## Methodology
1.	Import & Review Data
o	Load dataset into Tableau, confirm column types.
2.	Summarize Key Metrics
o	Define KPIs such as wait times, satisfaction scores, and admission counts.
3.	Plan Dashboard Layout
o	Organize sections for admissions, demographics, and satisfaction.
4.	Build Visuals
o	Create bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, and filters for interactivity.
5.	Test & Finalise
o	Validate accuracy of metrics.
o	Ensure dashboard usability for multiple stakeholders.

# Technical Highlights

• Calculated Fields: Used to compute KPIs such as admission rates, wait times, and average satisfaction scores.
• Trend Indicators: Incorporate colour-coded arrows indicating up or down trends with percentage changes via table calculations.
• Heatmap Visualisation: Designed to display hourly patient visits, highlighting peak hours and load distribution.
• Interactive Layout: Side navigation with hospital branding for quick access to essential information.
• Colour Encoding: Consistent red/orange scheme to reflect healthcare urgency and attention.

# Project includes
Overview: A summary of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as number of patients, numv=ber of admitted patience, average wait time and average performance score.

Admission status: Visual representations of admission status, showing total and maximum number of admitted and non admitted patience.

Patience race: Charts showing the current month number of patience with their race.

Gender distribution by age group: Donought charts illustrating the current moth number of patients with their gender distribution by age group.

Visit days: Heatmap showing the current monthe number of patients by hour of day visited

Timeline of weekly visit: Trent showing the current month number of patients by weekly visit.

Filtering and Interactivity: Interactive elements allowing users to filter data based on specific criteria and perform ad-hoc analysis.

## Technologies used

Excel: For data extraction and cleaning

Tableau: For data extraction, transformation, table joing, KPIs, vusualization, dashboard creation and data analysis.

## Conclusions

This HR Attrition Dashboard illustrates the value of visual analytics in workforce management. It enables HR stakeholders to identify attrition patterns, examine them alongside job satisfaction and demographic data, and make informed policy adjustments. The dashboard is modular, scalable, and adaptable to organisational datasets, making it a valuable addition to any HR analytics toolkit.
