# Emergency-Room-Dashboard
The Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard offers an interactive and visually engaging overview of patient flow and hospital annual performance. It consolidates vital metrics such as patient volume, admission rates, waiting times, and satisfaction levels into a single central interface, enabling healthcare administrators to monitor operational efficiency and real-time patient experience.

# Rationale

Emergency departments are high-pressure environments where delays or inefficiencies can greatly affect patient outcomes. Decision-makers need timely insights into patient demographics, admission trends, and service quality indicators. This dashboard was created to bridge the gap between raw hospital data and actionable insights, providing a user-friendly way to track hospital performance and spot trends for process improvement.

# Deliverable

The dashboard includes:
•Key Performance Metrics: Number of patients, admissions, average wait times, and satisfaction scores with trend indicators.
• Demographic Breakdown: Patient race and gender distribution by age group.
• Operational Insights: Visualisation of admission statuses to quickly assess care delivery efficiency.
• Temporal Analysis: A heatmap displaying peak visiting hours throughout the week.

# Technical Highlights

• Calculated Fields: Used to compute KPIs such as admission rates, wait times, and average satisfaction scores.
• Trend Indicators: Incorporate colour-coded arrows indicating up or down trends with percentage changes via table calculations.
• Heatmap Visualisation: Designed to display hourly patient visits, highlighting peak hours and load distribution.
• Interactive Layout: Side navigation with hospital branding for quick access to essential information.
• Colour Encoding: Consistent red/orange scheme to reflect healthcare urgency and attention.

#Conclusions

By merging patient demographics and operational metrics, this dashboard offers a comprehensive view of ER performance. It assists hospital managers in identifying bottlenecks, monitoring wait times, and tracking satisfaction in order to enhance care quality. Ultimately, it supports data-driven decision-making that improves patient outcomes and optimises resource allocation.
