# Emergency Room Dashboard

Heartbits Health operates a busy emergency room facility that receives hundreds of patients weekly. The hospital prioritises timely care, accurate patient tracking, and high-quality service delivery. As emergency room traffic continues to rise, Heartbits Health is facing growing pressure to deliver prompt and efficient care while maintaining high patient satisfaction. However, despite having access to basic operational metrics, Heartbits Health has struggled with effectively identifying peak periods, managing patient flow and reducing wait times, delivering prompt and efficient care that improves patient satisfaction and maintaining high patient satisfaction across demographics. This has necessitated the need for a more interactive and visual approach to understanding daily and hourly patient flow, race and age group distributions, and service responsiveness. They are therefore seeking a data science professional who will analyse their data and design an interactive ER dashboard that provides real-time insights for administrators, doctors, and stakeholders, empowering data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and patient outcomes. 

## Current Challenges

## Business Challenges
1.	Increasing Patient Volume
o	Growing ER traffic creates bottlenecks during peak hours.
2.	Wait Time Management
o	Patients experience delays due to poor resource allocation.
3.	Patient Satisfaction Tracking
o	Lack of comprehensive visibility into satisfaction trends by demographics.
4.	Equitable Care Delivery
o	Disparities in service responsiveness across different age and race groups.

## Data & Technical Challenges
1.	Data Fragmentation
o	Patient admissions, wait times, and satisfaction data are stored in silos.
2.	Limited Visualization
o	Existing reporting is static, limiting real-time decision-making.
3.	Granularity Issues
o	Difficulty tracking patient flow at hourly and daily levels.
4.	Scalability
o	Current monitoring does not adapt well to rising patient volumes.

## Aim
To develop an interactive Tableau dashboard that enables HeartBits Health to monitor ER performance in real time, reduce wait times, allocate staff efficiently, and improve patient satisfaction.

## Objectives
•	Operational Insights
o	Track admissions, discharges, and wait times.
o	Identify peak traffic hours to support scheduling.
•	Performance Monitoring
o	Measure patient satisfaction across age, race, and condition categories.
o	Detect service gaps for continuous improvement.
•	Resource Optimization
o	Support hospital administrators in allocating staff and resources effectively.
•	Data-Driven Decision Making
o	Enable management to make strategic and tactical decisions based on real-time data.

## Integration Strategy 
•	Data Sources:
o	Emergency room patient records.
o	Demographics (age, race).
o	Operational metrics (admissions, wait times, satisfaction scores).
•	Dashboard Scope:
o	Admissions and discharge trends.
o	Average wait times by demographic and time of day.
o	Patient satisfaction heatmaps.
o	Staff allocation insights.
•	Tools & Technology:
o	Tableau for dashboard creation.
o	Calculated fields for KPIs (wait time averages, satisfaction scores).
o	Filters for demographic and time-based analysis.

## Methodology
1.	Import & Review Data
o	Load dataset into Tableau, confirm column types.
2.	Summarize Key Metrics
o	Define KPIs such as wait times, satisfaction scores, and admission counts.
3.	Plan Dashboard Layout
o	Organize sections for admissions, demographics, and satisfaction.
4.	Build Visuals
o	Create bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, and filters for interactivity.
5.	Test & Finalise
o	Validate accuracy of metrics.
o	Ensure dashboard usability for multiple stakeholders.

# Technical Highlights

• Calculated Fields: Used to compute KPIs such as admission rates, wait times, and average satisfaction scores.
• Trend Indicators: Incorporate colour-coded arrows indicating up or down trends with percentage changes via table calculations.
• Heatmap Visualisation: Designed to display hourly patient visits, highlighting peak hours and load distribution.
• Interactive Layout: Side navigation with hospital branding for quick access to essential information.
• Colour Encoding: Consistent red/orange scheme to reflect healthcare urgency and attention.

## Conclusion
The HeartBits ER Dashboard demonstrates how healthcare operations are  transformed through real-time monitoring and data visualisation using Tableau. By identifying peak demand, optimising resource allocation, and tracking patient satisfaction, the dashboard provides actionable insights that directly improve efficiency and quality of care. This project showcased business intelligence and healthcare analytics, while addressing a real-world problem with data-driven solutions.
